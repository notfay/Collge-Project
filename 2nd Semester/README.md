Data Structures AOL Project | Project Grade : 94 (A)

In the second semester, students delve into Data Structures (COMP6048001) using C. Throughout this course, students learn about various fundamental data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary trees, and other related concepts. These structures serve as the building blocks for organizing and managing data efficiently. 

The final project assigned to students will be based on the knowledge and skills acquired during 
the semester, providing them with an opportunity to apply these concepts in practical scenarios. Following completion, the projects will be evaluated and scored by the lecturer as part of the Assurance of Learning (AOL) process.
