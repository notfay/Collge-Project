AOL Meaning:

As part of the Computer Science - Software Engineering course from BINUS University, each semester the students are given a final project or Assurance of Learning (AOL) to complete. The final project will be based on the concepts and skills learned throughout the entire semester. These projects serve as an opportunity for students to apply their knowledge in a practical setting. Subsequently, the projects will be assessed and scored by the lecturer to evaluate the students' understanding and proficiency in the subject matter.
